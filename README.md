Hello, I'm Challa Bhargav Krishna Yadavâ€”please, call me Bhargav.

For over a year, I've served as an Associate in Cybersecurity at PwC, navigating the complexities of digital defense. While this work has been formative, my curiosity is now pulling me toward a new frontier: Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

Armed with a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from VNIT, Nagpur, I am currently in the process of transitioning into this field. I'm driven by a deep passion for tackling work that is closely connected to the core concepts of life and evolution.

This core interest extends beyond technology; I'm always ready for a deep dive into physics, biology, and cosmology. Ultimately, I am looking to collaborate with intellectually driven people who consider "pushing the limit" to be their comfortable starting point.
